FlipRobo Technologies Assignment

Submitted By Razni Nazeem(Internship 26, FlipRobo Technologies)
With the covid 19 impact in the market, we have seen lot of changes in the car market. Now some cars are in demand hence making them costly and some are not in demand hence cheaper. One of our clients works with small traders, who sell used cars. With the change in market due to covid 19 impact, our client is facing problems with their previous car price valuation machine learning models. So, they are looking for new machine learning models from new data. We have to make car price valuation model. This project contains two phase-

Data Collection Phase
Model Building Phase
DataCollection Phase

In this section We need to scrape the data of used cars from websites (Olx, cardekho, Cars24 etc.). We need web scraping for this. We have to fetch data for different locations.

Model Building Phase

After collecting the data, you need to build a machine learning model. Before model building do all data pre-processing steps. Try different models with different hyper parameters and select the best model.

I have Included complete life cycle of data science.
